# AgingDrugOmics
This code uses metabolomic and proteomic plasma data to make predictions if a mouse has been given an anti-aging drug. This uses the ML model XGboost and requires both R and Python.

Step 1, and access to the raw data to run the code will be uploaded to this repo upon manuscript acceptance.
